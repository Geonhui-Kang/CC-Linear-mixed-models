1. What is mixed effects modelling and why does it matter?
Mixed models were developed, to deal with such messy data and to allow us to use all our data, even when we have low sample sizes, structured data and many covariates to fit.
Mixed models allow us to save degrees of freedom compared to running standard linear models.

2. Explore the data

3. Fit all data in one analysis

4. Run multiple analyses

5. Modify the current model

6. Mixed effects models

7. THE END
